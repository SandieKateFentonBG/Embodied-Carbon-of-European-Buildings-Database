# Embodied-Carbon-of-European-Buildings-Database (EU-ECB-DB)
## Description
A public repository focused on Embodied Carbon Data of Buildings across Europe. The repository provides the building LCA data compiled, processed and analyzed as well as the scripts used for processing, analysis and visualisation. Developed by [Martin RÃ¶ck (KU Leuven)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinroeck/)
and [Andreas Sorensen (Ramboll)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-soerensen/) within the ['Towards embodied carbon benchmarks for buildings in Europe' project](https://c.ramboll.com/lets-reduce-embodied-carbon).

## Documentation
The scripts provided in this repository have been established as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which contain annotations and comments for improved understanding. Documentation on the dataset, how it was built as well as some analyses and visualiation can be found in the related reports

# Background
## Embodied Carbon in the Building Sector
Funded by the [Laudes Foundation](https://www.laudesfoundation.org/), the project '['Towards embodied carbon benchmarks for buildings in Europe' project](https://c.ramboll.com/lets-reduce-embodied-carbon), by [Ramboll](https://ramboll.com/) in collaboration with leading researchers from [Aalborg University Build](https://www.build.aau.dk/) and [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/research/), set out a framework for benchmarking and limiting the embodied carbon of new buildings.

The study identified solutions to measure embodied carbon emissions, define carbon budgets and targets. Importantly it includes recommendations for a baseline of current embodied carbon levels in new buildings, as well as considerations of the available carbon budget for these emissions. This will form the basis of a performance system in the shape of benchmarks for the reduction of embodied carbon.
